Overall Vision <br>
The overarching vision for GlobeTrotter is to become a personalized,
intelligent, and collaborative platform that transforms the way individu-
als plan and experience travel. The platform aims to empower users to
dream, design, and organize trips with ease by offering an end-to-end
travel planning tool that combines flexibility and interactivity.
It envisions a world where users can explore global destinations, visu-
alize their journeys through structured itineraries, make cost-effective
decisions, and share their travel plans within a community—making
travel planning as exciting as the trip itself.
